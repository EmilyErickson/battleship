# Battleship

This project is part of the Odin Project's Javascript course. The goal of this project was to build a battleship game that is played against a computer. One of the main purposes of this project was to practice using test driven development (TDD).

Using tests helped get the initial functions of the game set up more efficiently.

This game was build with:

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Jest
